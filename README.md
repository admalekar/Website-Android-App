# Android-PWA-Wrapper

A sample Android Wrapper application to create a native Android App from an offline-capable Progressive Web App.

Drafted for the [Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.xtools.leasingrechner&utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=store_visit) of my [Leasing Calculator](https://www.leasingrechnen.at) Web App using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), [Materialize.css](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize) and a lot of Offline-First love over at [leasingrechnen.at](https://www.leasingrechnen.at).

## Why would I use a wrapper?
I know, using a Wrapper-App to display a Website can feel a bit odd. But there are a few good reasons why you'd package your Web App like this.
- If you've got a very sophisticated UI already, it might make sense not to rebuild it from scratch for multiple platforms, especally if it's a Single Page Application already, that doesn't "feel" like a Website.
- There might be as well less competition for a given niche on App Stores, in comparison to Google directly. With [leasingrechnen.at](https://www.leasingrechnen.at), I've got easily into the Top 10 Apps on Google Play for my country, whereas Google Search put me on page 9 as the Site is relatively new.

## What it does
- Sets up a WebView just the way PWAs/SPAs like it (e.g. enables App cache and DOM storage, ...).
- Shows a loading spinner while fetching the Web App.
- Provided your Web App is Offline-capable, it only needs an Internet connection on the first startup. If this fails, it shows a native refresh widget.
- Opens all external URLs in the device's Browser instead.
- Checks for Internet connection and fetches Updates for your Web App accordingly.
- Is compatible down to JellyBean, although it's recommended to build for SDK Version >= 19 (KitKat). Building for SDK Version >= 21 (Lollipop) puts you on the safe side without having to worry too much about Browser support.
- APK-size < 1.4 MB. The latest cat video from WhatsApp weighs heavier ;)

## How to build your own
- Clone/fork repository
- Put your Web App's URL in _WEBAPP_URL_ in `Constants.java`
- Replace *app_name* in `strings.xml` with the name of your App
- Add your own primary colors to `colors.xml` (*colorPrimary, colorPrimaryDark, colorPrimaryLight*)
- Put your own icons in place:
    - Add your own _ic_launcher.png_ and _ic_launcher_round.png_ in the `mipmap` folders
    - Add your own _ic_appbar.png_ in the `drawables` folders. This is displayed in Android's _Recent Apps_ View on your app bar, so it should look nicely when placed on top of your primary color.
    - I recommend using [Android Asset Studio](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio) to get the icons ready in no time
- Change the package name in `app/build.gradle`, *applicationId*
- Check `Constants.java` for more options
- Build App in Android Studio
